# Compiler

As part of a compilation course, I was required to build a compiler for a programming language defined by rules given to me.

The project was built in three stages:
1. Syntax error detection by building an AST (Tree Syntax Abstract).
2. Performing semantic tests and displaying errors accordingly. 
3. Translation of the code entered into 3AC (3-address-code).

using: LEX, YACC, C.
Operating system: Linux
